Hi, I am Dmitry! Learning technologies that I found interesting.
I do mobile development. Android studio java. In the application released game, on the initial page, you need to enter the name and number of beetles,
when you press Play button starts the game, to get points you need to tap on the beetles moving on the display,
when you destroy two beetles with one tap adds a bonus point and additional animation.
