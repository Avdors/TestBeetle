Hello, I'm Dmitry, I study technologies that seemed interesting to me. I am engaged in mobile development. Android studio java. In the application released game,
on the initial page you need to enter the name and number of bugs, when you press Play button starts the game, to get points you need to tap on the bugs moving on the display, when you destroy two bugs with one tap adds a bonus point and additional animation.

Through the service is realized the launch of background music. The state of each beetle is processed in a separate thread.
